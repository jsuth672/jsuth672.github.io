<h2> About me </h2>
<p1> My name is Justin Michael Sutherland and I am an Freshman Information Technology major at <a href="http://www.bju.edu/"> Bob Jones University 
</a> Although I am a full-time student, I am currently employed part-time at  Zaxby's  I enjoy physical activities such as jogging or playing footblall. In addition
to physical activities, I also enjoy hanging out with friends and just talking about life. In the future, I would love to use my degree in Information Technology to
advance the Gospel arround the globe. Thank you for visiting my site!

<h3> My hobbies</h3>
<p2> One of my favorite activities is reselling electronics. A number of years back, when I was in 8th grade or so, I saw some 
incredible deals on a classifieds site called Craigslist. I decided to 
buy them and resell them on other online sites. Although I do not do it much
anymore, it is still very enjoyable! Another hobby of mine is collecting Legos. I have always enjoyed legos and decided to start 
a small collection of some of the more expensive sets. My collection also doubles as a long term investment. Legos tend to appreciate better than 
a savings account, so now I can use the excuse of "investments" to buy more!
